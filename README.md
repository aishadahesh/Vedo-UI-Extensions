### Overview:
In this repository, we have extended the Vedo library with additional components. Below is an explanation of each implementation:

1. **Check Box:**
 - The check box allows users to toggle between two states (checked/unchecked). It is useful for enabling/disabling specific options in the user interface.

2. **Combo Box:**
 - The combo box presents a dropdown menu of selectable options. Users can choose one item from the list, making it suitable for selecting from a predefined set of choices.

3. **Radio Button:**
 - Radio buttons are used when users need to select exactly one option from a set of mutually exclusive choices. Each radio button can be selected individually, and selecting one deselects any others in the same group.

4. **Color Picker:**
 - The color picker enables users to choose colors interactively. It provides a visual interface for selecting colors using a color wheel or entering color values directly.

5. **Text Box:**
 - **Version 1:**
   - Version 1 of the text box provides basic text input functionality. Users can type and edit text within a defined area.
 - **Version 2:**
   - Version 2 extends the text box with additional features such as multiline support, text formatting options, and event handling for key presses.

6. **Toggle Switch:**
 - The toggle switch offers a simple way to toggle between two states, typically on/off or true/false. It provides a visual indication of the current state and allows users to change it with a single click.

7. **Adder:**
 - The adder component allows users to perform arithmetic operations interactively. It provides input fields for users to enter numbers and buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

8. **Text Editor:**
